# bei_secret_santa_core

The Secret Santa Core exercise in our Backend Internship program.

## Rules

- each one will only work in their respective directory;
- you should push code changes as often as possible (at least twice a day);
- you already have a pseudo-testing code in `index.php` in your respective directory;

## Tests

We use PHPUnit tests. See here for more details: https://phpunit.de/getting-started/phpunit-7.html

To use the tests first run this `composer install` in the `tests` directory.

Then, still in the `tests` directory, run `./vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap angel/bootstrap.php angel` to run the tests for Angel.
